{"authorUserId": "34134", "description": "This arrangement start with three friends who like to fool around with the music we love. Specially music made by every thing but recorders. \r\nBefore my final exam  at the School of Music in Amsterdam I showed my teacher  the piece my friend made of the music we fooled around with and told her that that I like to play that on my exam.\r\nLuckely she liked it and helped us made it the exciting piece it is now.  I played it on my exam with three bassrecorders.  Now I want to play it again with some friends on our eagle recorders so I modified it a bit. \r\n\r\nSome notes to play this piece: When you see a cross instead of a tone you play it \"spooked\" hold the air behind your tongue and let it explode (like a mute on a guitar) \"Con voce\" means you sing and blow air in your recorder (sounds a bit like destortion on a guitar)\r\n\r\nIt is a challenging and fun piece to play on alto ar bass recorders.\r\n", "instrumentsNames": [], "title": "Tea (Without sugar)", "url": "/user/34134/scores/103554", "partsCount": "3", "revisionId": "141362", "pagesCount": "9", "partsNames": ["", "", ""], "timeUpdated": "2018-07-16 08:57:45 UTC", "instrumentsCount": "0", "duration": "260", "timeCreated": "2013-04-29 09:20:05 UTC", "id": "103554", "__error__": [], "musicxmlInstruments": []}
