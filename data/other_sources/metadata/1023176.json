{"authorUserId": "206273", "description": "Hello there viewer,\r\nIt's been a while since I've put something on this account, and for that I apologize, but I will hopefully be creating more content soon over the summer. \r\nI recently saw the new Disney Pixar movie, Inside Out, and I really liked it. It easily became one of my favorite Pixar movies, and so I figured, what better way to plat homage to such an incredible film that to arrange it's main theme. So I did. \r\nThanks everyone for commenting, following, and favorite-ing. It makes me smile to see people enjoy these thing I put so much work into.\r\nSee you again soon,\r\nThe Ginger\r\n\r\nAll respective rights to this song belong to Disney, Pixar, and the composer, Michael Giacchino.
