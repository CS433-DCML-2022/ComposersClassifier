{"authorUserId": "68570", "description": "I decided to make a video game medley for three tenor saxophones (mainly because I play in a high school band and have a tenor saxophone section of three). I took ideas they all gave me and put it all in to one medley. Please comment and tell me what you think because this peice alone took me a long time and hours of creating. I really hope you enjoy and tell your friends!!! I will also be taking suggestions of what I can add to make this even better if you would like to tell me what you think and would like to see!
