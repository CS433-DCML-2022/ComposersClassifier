{"authorUserId": "84251", "description": "A lovely part-song by Sir Arthur Sullivan, the musical half of Gilbert and Sullivan.  It was written in 1868 for four voices and an optional keyboard accompaniment.  This music is said to have been a frequent selection at the funerals of D'Oyly Carte opera company members.  Here, the vocal parts are taken by a wind ensemble.  A (generous) friend of mine has described this arrangement as \"a glorious Victorian sunset.\"", "instrumentsNames": [], "title": "Sir Arthur Sullivan: The Long Day Closes", "url": "/user/84251/scores/100980", "partsCount": "7", "revisionId": "137747", "pagesCount": "8", "partsNames": ["Soprano Recorder", "Tenor Recorder", "Flute", "English Horn", "Bassoon", "Euphonium", "Harmonium"], "timeUpdated": "2019-08-16 13:35:27 UTC", "instrumentsCount": "0", "duration": "238", "timeCreated": "2013-04-14 22:50:53 UTC", "id": "100980", "__error__": [], "musicxmlInstruments": []}
