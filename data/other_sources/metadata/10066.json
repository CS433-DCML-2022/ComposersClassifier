{"authorUserId": "4034", "description": "This truly special piece of music means very much to me. I dedicated it to my band teacher, Mark Rymer after he passed away at a very young age of 34. The beginning of the piece, the first statement, was created one day before his death as I was inspired to write like Hans Zimmer, then suddenly, the unfortunate event happened. I worked day and night to create the piece for band. \r\n\r\nYouTube Link to this song - Original Version of this song played on a Yamaha \r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C2PM0GCt5Q\r\n", "instrumentsNames": [], "title": "In the Footsteps of Those Before You (Rest Forever Requiem) First Version", "url": "/user/4034/scores/10066", "partsCount": "24", "revisionId": "26939", "pagesCount": "18", "partsNames": ["Piccolo", "Flute", "Oboe", "E?
