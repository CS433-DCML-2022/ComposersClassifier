{"authorUserId": "81853", "description": "So it seriously took me longer to name this song than it did to write it. I was at the piano for about ten minutes, just playing stuff and I though it sounded kind of good (hey, that's a first). Then I videotaped myself playing, arranged my little bits into a song in about a half hour, and here we are. I'll post a videoscore soon, but I'm not going to do it tonight because people are asleep at my house :( Also, if you care, here's how I thought of this name: So pretty much I was trying to remember what I was thinking about when I was writing it. And I was thinking about deep chiz like my future and stuff because today my band teacher found a cd of my scores that I've been wanting to give him for like a few months. He listened to them and said they were good and that I could go places with this if I commit myself. (The cd had mostly original stuff on it.) We are now playing one of my songs in band for our next concert (!!!!!). So ANYWHO! That's what I was thinking about when I was writing this. I had that feeling, you know, when you're just like insanely excited for everything and you aren't thinking about the fact that you have to go to gym tomorrow and physically exert yourself or teach kids at church, you're just excited about everything. And I was trying to name that feeling. And, after a while, I just decided the best way to describe it was infinite. Not thinking about all the bad things that may happen, that will inevitibly happen, but just feeling like you could do anything right in that moment. So yeah. Deep chiz over. Bah homies comment yo thoughts on dis chiz! \r\n\r\nP.S. I just read that over and realized how insanely Perks of Being a Wallflower it sounded. So yeah, I didn't mean to do that...
