{"authorUserId": "77705", "description": "Mt near final draft of the Nintendo medley for an orchestra. I've learnt many things (turns out the trombones aren't as good as I thought). I've arsed up a few times (I'm still blagging the percussion). But I've had some great help (/r/composer). Thank you all. I'm showing it to the music  teacher at school tomorrow to see what she says, and also to enquire about music theory lessons (I need at least Grade 7 by early January to get into the university course I want to get on - I haven't done one yet)", "instrumentsNames": ["Flute", "Oboe", "Clarinet", "Bassoon", "French Horn", "Trumpet", "Trombone", "Strings(4)", "Contrabass", "Timpani", "Percussion(5)"], "title": "Nintendo Medley for an Orchestra - Mk.
