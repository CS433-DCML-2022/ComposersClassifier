{"authorUserId": "3649801", "description": "A rather Baroque sounding 3 part tune for 2 mandolins and a bass, probably Italian, by the well known composer 'Anon'. I downloaded a midi file  from somewhere on the Internet and changed the 2nd mandolin part considerably because it was rather odd and mostly in unison. The rest is mainly as it was when I downloaded it. There are 2 other scores, an Allegro and a Largo, also available here. It is available on Freescores.com and there was no attribution. This can be said to be my version. I hope you enjoy it.", "instrumentsNames": ["Guitar(2)", "Cello"], "title": "Trio Mandolini Y Basso ", "url": "/user/3649801/scores/1032906", "partsCount": "3", "revisionId": "1430171", "pagesCount": "3", "partsNames": ["", "", ""], "timeUpdated": "2018-07-16 08:59:49 UTC", "instrumentsCount": "2", "duration": "135", "timeCreated": "2015-07-07 17:17:14 UTC", "id": "1032906", "__error__": [], "musicxmlInstruments": []}
