{"authorUserId": "3590271", "description": "Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team is by far one of my favorite games out there. It was the first game I could call my own and I spent countless hours playing it. Not only is the story FANTASTIC, but the music is amazing as well! Such soul!\r\nThis is an arrangement of the soundtrack \"Snow Refugees (Escape Through the Snow)\", and it also takes motives from \"Run Away\" as well. Also there are dumb lyrics wooooo\r\nThe top voice is the player's partner and the tenor is the player (Their voices are just based on who my characters were in my game) and also the crescendos got all messed up.\r\nAs always, feel free to comment and ENJOY!\r\n~Eileen", "instrumentsNames": ["Voice(4)", "French Horn", "Percussion(4)", "Piano(2)", "Harp", "Harpsichord", "Strings(3)"], "title": "Snow Refugees", "url": "/user/3590271/scores/1024101", "partsCount": "16", "revisionId": "1414701", "pagesCount": "21", "partsNames": ["Boy Soprano", "Tenor", "Horn", "Glockenspiel", "Tubular Bells", "Sleigh Bells", "Soprano", "Baritone", "Piano", "Celesta", "Harp", "Violins 1", "Violins 2", "Violas", "Violoncellos", "Contrabasses"], "timeUpdated": "2018-07-16 08:59:45 UTC", "instrumentsCount": "7", "duration": "241", "timeCreated": "2015-07-03 17:34:44 UTC", "id": "1024101", "__error__": [], "musicxmlInstruments": []}
