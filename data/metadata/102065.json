{"authorUserId": "85804", "description": "The <i>Cantus alphabeti</i> is a list of \"vices\" and \"virtues\", sometimes transmitted together with the <i>Nota hanc imaginem</i> treatise. Their origins are clearly intertwined. \"Virtues\" and \"vices\" are connected to each of the 23 letters of the alphabet, which have to be sung to slightly differring melodies at the interval of a quart and an octave. (The \"virtues\" and \"vices\" in this context are nothing else than words with positive and negative connotations.) Words beginning with the letters ABCD and NOPQ have to be sung in the first tune, EFGH and RSTU to the second tune, IKLM and XYZ to the third tune. Our rendering is slightly modernized and polyphonic.  \r\n ", "instrumentsNames": [], "title": "Cantus Alphabeti", "url": "/user/85804/scores/102065", "partsCount": "3", "revisionId": "139283", "pagesCount": "2", "partsNames": ["Baritone Solo", "Baritone Solo", "Bass Solo"], "timeUpdated": "2018-07-16 08:57:42 UTC", "instrumentsCount": "0", "duration": "108", "timeCreated": "2013-04-21 11:18:45 UTC", "id": "102065", "__error__": [], "musicxmlInstruments": []}
