It's been a while since I've put something on this account, and for that I apologize, but I will hopefully be creating more content soon over the summer. 
I recently saw the new Disney Pixar movie, Inside Out, and I really liked it. It easily became one of my favorite Pixar movies, and so I figured, what better way to plat homage to such an incredible film that to arrange it's main theme. So I did. 
Thanks everyone for commenting, following, and favorite-ing. It makes me smile to see people enjoy these thing I put so much work into.
See you again soon,
The Ginger

1018926	Anonimo	O leggiadri occhi belli; Anonimo - O leggiadri occhi belli - b minor	"Arietta  by an unknown composer.

This ancient italian arietta has been transposed in severeal tonalities in order to present a choice for any voice and to allow interesting technical studies with a pianist or harpsichord player who are given here a maximum of comfort because they do not have to transpose by sight. It's surely possible to find these ariettas in several tonalities, but they haven't been edited in so many moods as in this collection, going from very high to very deep voices. Besides the fact, that it may be possible, by this way, to discover the best tune for any type of voice, this collection also allows technical trips towards the boundaries of any singer's high and/or low limits.

Here are the chosen tonalities for this arietta (from high to low voice):

I was at the piano for about ten minutes, just playing stuff and I though it sounded kind of good (hey, that's a first). Then I videotaped myself playing, arranged my little bits into a song in about a half hour, and here we are. I'll post a videoscore soon, but I'm not going to do it tonight because people are asleep at my house :( Also, if you care, here's how I thought of this name: So pretty much I was trying to remember what I was thinking about when I was writing it. And I was thinking about deep chiz like my future and stuff because today my band teacher found a cd of my scores that I've been wanting to give him for like a few months. He listened to them and said they were good and that I could go places with this if I commit myself. (The cd had mostly original stuff on it.) We are now playing one of my songs in band for our next concert (!!!!!). So ANYWHO! That's what I was thinking about when I was writing this. I had that feeling, you know, when you're just like insanely excited for everything and you aren't thinking about the fact that you have to go to gym tomorrow and physically exert yourself or teach kids at church, you're just excited about everything. And I was trying to name that feeling. And, after a while, I just decided the best way to describe it was infinite. Not thinking about all the bad things that may happen, that will inevitibly happen, but just feeling like you could do anything right in that moment. So yeah. Deep chiz over. Bah homies comment yo thoughts on dis chiz! 

P.S. I just read that over and realized how insanely Perks of Being a Wallflower it sounded. So yeah, I didn't mean to do that... XD"

Setting #2 of the (at least) 3 by Aleksei Turenkov (1886-1958) of the Orthodox (Good Friday) Exapostilarion of the Wise Thief, ""Razboinika Blagorazumnago"" (the text is in Old Church Slavonic).  In its 20 measures/two minutes, this short work seems to pack many of the most affecting, earmark chords and tropes of 19th-20th century Russian Orthodox Church Music, imbuing it with the rich, dark, mystery of Orthodox Holy Week.

The text speaks of the ""good"" thief, him crucified to the right of Jesus, who confesses Jesus (""O Lord"") petitioning to remember him when he arrives in Heaven (Luke 23:42-43); Jesus grants his prayer, ""This-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise"".   There is extensive discussion of the significance of this in various traditions at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penitent_thief, and in Orthodoxy in particular at http://orthodoxwiki.org/Dismas_the_thief .  In brief, he is instantly saved by Jesus because of his confession of faith in his request; the incident is taken (in these traditions) as a proof-text of the sufficiency and necessity of confession and faith for Salvation.

The text in transliteration and translation, reflecting this, reads

Razboinika blagorazumnago    // The wise thief
Vo yedinom chasye                   //In one instant
Rayevi spodobil yesi, Gospodi.  //Madest thou worthy of Paradise, O Lord.
I mene drevom krestnym          //And me, too, by the Wood of the Cross,
Prosvyeti i spasi mya!               //Illumine and save me!

This text/setting is employed before Communion on (Orthodox) Good Friday.
The settings are often, but not uniformly, dark and mysterious, as is Turenkov's, here.
The present setting brings us rampant minor sixth chords, flat and minor ninth chords, augmented sixths French and German and in third inversion, -profundo- writing, and many other ""standard"" gestures of 19th-20th century Russian Church Music that contribute to its exquisite, dark, mysterious sound (in many works).  The intensity and concision of this short work are exceptional.

Russian Orthodox Church Music is without exception in Old Church Slavonic, the predecessor of Russian, Bulgarian, and other modern Slavic languages, and a cappella.  The use of ""16' bass singers"" (""oktavists"") is traditional too; their parts are sometimes written, but often added as a ""pedal stop"" by directors (organs are not ever used). Numerous recordings of these remarkable men are to be found on the web (start at http://www.oktavism.com).

I worked from a PDF score I ""just found in Russia"", although I have known the work from a handwritten score given to me by the late Igor Studenzoff, formerly of the Don Cossacks, in 1972 at Harvard.  I first encountered it on Spassky's 1954 ""Grand Prix du Disque"" LP of Holy Week and Pontifical Liturgy, recorded at the Cathédrale Alexandre Nevsky on the Rue Daru.

I think the ""Choeur de l'Église Russe de MIDI"" does a pretty fine job here, considering.

I have a cello recital on the fourth with my cello choir, and as much as I need to practice my part in ""Macabre for Four Cellos"", I would rather not die of heat stroke alone in my room, and thus the air conditioning made it nearly impossible for me to play the right notes. What I was able to play sounded just about as non-complex and simple as this, although altogether I think it sounds pretty interesting."

103554		Thee (zonder suiker); Tea (Without sugar)	"This arrangement start with three friends who like to fool around with the music we love. Specially music made by every thing but recorders. 
Before my final exam  at the School of Music in Amsterdam I showed my teacher  the piece my friend made of the music we fooled around with and told her that that I like to play that on my exam.
Luckely she liked it and helped us made it the exciting piece it is now.  I played it on my exam with three bassrecorders.  Now I want to play it again with some friends on our eagle recorders so I modified it a bit. 

Some notes to play this piece: When you see a cross instead of a tone you play it ""spooked"" hold the air behind your tongue and let it explode (like a mute on a guitar) ""Con voce"" means you sing and blow air in your recorder (sounds a bit like destortion on a guitar)

It is a challenging and fun piece to play on alto ar bass recorders.

1001271	Michael Richardson	The Gravekeeper's Requiem	"There once was a little girl, who visited the local cemetery every single day. It was curious why she’d do so, as no one she knew was buried there.

But every single day, she’d give the gravekeeper—a derelict, disheveled but kindly mess of a man—one wool flower. She had to, because for some reason vandals continuously stole every flower she brought to him. 

He was neither perturbed by the vandals nor did he express any anger towards them, even when they knocked over graves. It was always the same raucous kids she went to school with, so she asked the gravekeeper why he did nothing to take back the now-hundreds of flowers that had been stolen from him.

“Old Tomb Keeper, why do you sit idle as your life’s work is vandalized?” she asked politely.

The old man had no answer.

When the old man finally died, there was no one to mourn and no one to care—save the girl. When she placed a wool flower upon his grave, as did one of the vandals.

“Why do you mourn him now?” she asked quietly.

“I am merely returning what my friends cannot.” He said, looking to their grave markers and walking away.

This ancient italian arietta has been transposed in severeal tonalities in order to present a choice for any voice and to allow interesting technical studies with a pianist or harpsichord player who are given here a maximum of comfort because they do not have to transpose by sight. It's surely possible to find these ariettas in several tonalities, but they haven't been edited in so many moods as in this collection, going from very high to very deep voices. Besides the fact, that it may be possible, by this way, to discover the best tune for any type of voice, this collection also allows technical trips towards the boundaries of any singer's high and/or low limits.

Here are the chosen tonalities for this arietta (from high to low voice):

Vatican City State has its own flag and anthem like any other universally recognized, sovereign nation. On 16 October 1949 Pope Pius XII decided that Charles Gounod’s (1818-1893) Pontifical March should become the official hymn. At the time, the French musician and devout Catholic was already a famous composer, especially well known for his lyrical work Faust and his composition of Ave Maria.

El Estado de la Ciudad del Vaticano es un ente soberano de derecho público reconocido universalmente, con bandera propia e himno oficial.

Unfortunately, the video is fraught with some very annoying clicks, so that's just something I'll apologize for in advance. There was no getting rid of them.

Their origins are clearly intertwined. ""Virtues"" and ""vices"" are connected to each of the 23 letters of the alphabet, which have to be sung to slightly differring melodies at the interval of a quart and an octave. (The ""virtues"" and ""vices"" in this context are nothing else than words with positive and negative connotations.) Words beginning with the letters ABCD and NOPQ have to be sung in the first tune, EFGH and RSTU to the second tune, IKLM and XYZ to the third tune. Our rendering is slightly modernized and polyphonic.

In dem folgenden Text geht es um den Diebstahl von Donuts:

Meine Donuts sind weg.

Ich war gestern Nacht an meinem Kühlschrank,
doch weil ich leider nicht das darin fand,
was ich erwartet hatte, wo sind sie hin?
Wie weggezaubert, so simsalabim.
Meine Donuts verschwunden, ich raste aus,
schau`aus dem Fenster von meinem Haus,
Jerry liegt in der Matte und macht sich ´nen Schmaus
und frisst meine letzten Donuts auf.
Eigentlich war´s Tag, doch was jetzt interresiert,
ist die Frage wo Jerry dahinschielt,
wahrscheinlich auf mich mit der Springfield,
der gerade exakt unter sein Kinn zielt.
Daneben geschossen, er rennt wie besoffen,
der er kann nur hoffen nicht von mir getroffen
zu werden und nicht elend zu sterben.
Man wird wohl nurnoch seine Leiche bergen,
er kickt das Kind weg, klaut den Roller,
ich schau`zum Zoo, denk`mir nur so: Soll`er,
weg laufen, ich klau`mir einfach ein Lama,
ich verfolg`ihn als Dieb für millionen Dollar,
ich mach`diesen Donut-Räuber kalt,
verfolge ihn in Richtung Wald,
mit Gebrüll so dass es schallt,
aus  dem Febüsch kommt `ne Gestalt.

Bayang magiliw 
Perlas ng silanganan 
Alab ng puso 
Sa dibdib mo'y buhay 

Lupang Hinirang 
Duyan ka nang magiting 
Sa manlulupig 
Di ka pasisiil 

Sa Dagat at bundok sa simoy 
At sa langit mo'y bughaw 
May dilag ang tula 
At awit sa paglayang minamahal 
Ang kislap ng watawat mo'y tagumpay na nagniningning 
Ang bituin at araw niya'y kailanpama'y di magdidilim 

Lupa ng araw ng luwalhati't pagsinta 
Buhay ay langit sa piling mo 
Aming ligaya nang pag 
May mang-aapi 
Ang mamatay ng dahil sayo"

As some of you might have guessed, the title does in fact mean that a song is coming soon (I hope) that will be entitled ""War Is Here"" or something to that effect.

Please let me know if you liked it and comment if you have any suggestions or criticisms, they are very much appreciated!! =D"
