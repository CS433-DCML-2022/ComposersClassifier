{"authorUserId": "27818", "description": "There once was a little girl, who visited the local cemetery every single day. It was curious why she\u2019d do so, as no one she knew was buried there.\r\n\r\nBut every single day, she\u2019d give the gravekeeper\u2014a derelict, disheveled but kindly mess of a man\u2014one wool flower. She had to, because for some reason vandals continuously stole every flower she brought to him. \r\n\r\nHe was neither perturbed by the vandals nor did he express any anger towards them, even when they knocked over graves. It was always the same raucous kids she went to school with, so she asked the gravekeeper why he did nothing to take back the now-hundreds of flowers that had been stolen from him.\r\n\r\n\u201cOld Tomb Keeper, why do you sit idle as your life\u2019s work is vandalized?\u201d she asked politely.\r\n\r\nThe old man had no answer.\r\n\r\nWhen the old man finally died, there was no one to mourn and no one to care\u2014save the girl. When she placed a wool flower upon his grave, as did one of the vandals.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you mourn him now?\u201d she asked quietly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am merely returning what my friends cannot.\u201d He said, looking to their grave markers and walking away.\r\n", "instrumentsNames": ["Strings(2)"], "title": "The Gravekeeper's Requiem", "url": "/user/27818/scores/1001271", "partsCount": "2", "revisionId": "1383221", "pagesCount": "3", "partsNames": ["Violins", "Violoncellos"], "timeUpdated": "2018-07-16 08:59:40 UTC", "instrumentsCount": "1", "duration": "355", "timeCreated": "2015-06-28 06:30:39 UTC", "id": "1001271", "__error__": [], "musicxmlInstruments": [], "__terminated__": true, "last_error": "Score.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'level'", "ms3_metadata": {"arranger": "", "composer": "Michael Richardson", "copyright": "", "creationDate": "2015-06-27", "lyricist": "Michael Richardson", "movementNumber": "", "movementTitle": "", "mscVersion": "3.02", "platform": "Microsoft Windows", "poet": "", "source": "", "translator": "", "workNumber": "", "workTitle": "The Gravekeeper's Daughter", "composer_text": "Michael Richardson", "title_text": "The Gravekeeper's Requiem", "musescore": "3.6.2", "last_mc": 142, "last_mn": 142, "length_qb": 284.0, "length_qb_unfolded": 284.0, "label_count": 0, "TimeSig": {"1": "2/4"}, "KeySig": {"1": 5}, "all_notes_qb": 918.5, "n_onsets": 654, "n_onset_positions": 356, "parts": {"part_1": {"staves": [1], "trackName": "Violins", "longName": "Violins", "shortName": "Vlns.", "instrument": "Violins", "staff_1_ambitus": {"min_midi": 59, "min_name": "B3", "max_midi": 76, "max_name": "E5"}}, "part_2": {"staves": [2], "trackName": "Violoncellos", "longName": "Violoncellos", "shortName": "Vlcs.", "instrument": "Violoncellos", "staff_2_ambitus": {"min_midi": 37, "min_name": "C#2", "max_midi": 64, "max_name": "E4"}}}, "ambitus": {"min_midi": 37, "min_name": "C#2", "max_midi": 76, "max_name": "E5"}}, "musescore_metadata": {"metadata": {"composer": "Michael Richardson", "duration": 355, "fileVersion": 302, "hasHarmonies": "false", "hasLyrics": "false", "keysig": 5, "lyrics": "", "measures": 142, "mscoreVersion": "3.6.2", "pageFormat": {"height": 279, "twosided": "true", "width": 216}, "pages": 3, "parts": [{"harmonyCount": 0, "hasDrumStaff": "false", "hasPitchedStaff": "true", "hasTabStaff": "false", "instrumentId": "strings.group", "isVisible": "true", "lyricCount": 0, "name": "Violins", "program": 48}, {"harmonyCount": 0, "hasDrumStaff": "false", "hasPitchedStaff": "true", "hasTabStaff": "false", "instrumentId": "strings.group", "isVisible": "true", "lyricCount": 0, "name": "Violoncellos", "program": 48}], "poet": "Michael Richardson", "previousSource": "", "subtitle": "", "tempo": 48, "tempoText": "<sym>metNoteQuarterUp</sym> = 48", "textFramesData": {"composers": ["Michael Richardson"], "poets": [], "subtitles": [], "titles": ["The Gravekeeper's Requiem"]}, "timesig": "2/4", "title": "The Gravekeeper's Requiem"}}, "first_composer": null}
